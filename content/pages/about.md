Hello there! My name is **Mukesh Dasari** and I am a **Programmer**. I consider myself an explorer and problem solver. Exploring new Technologies and Frameworks is my hobby. 

Currently I am pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from University of North Carolina at Charlotte, United States of America. I have work experience in Fullstack Development and Natural Language Processing applications. Being a part of Fintech Company I worked on some of the amazing Financial Domain products and applications.

My area of interest is Natural Language Processing and I am digging dipper in some NLP tools and libraries like Dialogflow, RASA and CoreNLP.


Some more things about me. I like to travel, explore new places and meet new awesome people who make world better. Also I love mountains. Himalaya's are my love but I have started dating some of the mountains in United States :D. Currenlty I am learning German and improving my guitar skills in spare time. So I am looking for people to interact in Deutsch to improve it. So, if you are the one then let's catch up on coffee.

Here is my [Resume!](../mukesh-resume.pdf)
